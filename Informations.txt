In this folder there are:
1) Matlab file for the first implementation of the SIFT/BoW based model
2) Colab file for the second implementation of the SIFT/BoW based model
3) Colab file for the implementation of the CNN based model

4) Pdf of the technical report
5) Pdf of the slides for the presentation

There are also saved models/variables used in the Colab files, we report them here but they are not actually needed by the user,
they do not need to be uploaded in Colab since the code uploads them by itself (the same happens for the dataset):
- folder "Best Models/Variables" that contains:
	- Bag of Words parameters
	- best trained SVC classifier
	- best trained CNN model
- folder "Testing_diffusion" that contains the images generated by the diffusion model used for evaluation
